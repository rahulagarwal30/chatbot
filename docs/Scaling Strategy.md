# Scaling Strategy

## Chatbot Component Scaling

- **Load Distribution**
  - Deploy load balancer with sticky sessions
  - Configure auto-scaling based on request volume
  - Implement horizontal scaling for chatbot instances
  - Set up Redis for session management

### CDN Integration
- **Static Content Delivery**
  - Cache static UI assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
  - Configure CDN caching rules and TTL
  - Implement cache invalidation strategy

### OpenAI Service Management
- **API Optimization**
  - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Add request rate limiting to stay within API quotas
  - Cache similar queries and responses to reduce API calls
  - Implement chunking for long content to reduce token usage


## Crawler Component Scaling

### Distributed Crawling
- **Worker Management**
  - Implement worker pools for parallel crawling
  - Configure worker auto-scaling based on queue length
  - Track crawl state for resume/restart capabilities

- **Queue System**
  - Deploy RabbitMQ/Kafka for job distribution
  - Implement Dead Letter Queues for failed jobs
  - Separate queues for different crawl priorities
  - Monitor queue health and performance

### Resource Management
- **Rate Limiting**
  - Implement per-domain crawl limits
  - Configure global crawl rate limits
  - Set timeouts for crawler operations
  - Monitor and adjust based on target site responses

### CDN Integration
- **Crawled Content Delivery**
  - Cache frequently accessed documents
  - Implement regional content distribution
  - Set up edge caching for popular content
  - Configure cache purging for updated content

## Shared Infrastructure

### Storage Optimization
- **Elasticsearch Optimization**
  - Enable document compression
  - Implement index sharding
  - Monitor query performance

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Chatbot Metrics**
  - Response times and error rates
  - Token usage and API costs
  - Session counts and concurrent users
  - Cache hit rates

- **Crawler Metrics**
  - Pages crawled per minute
  - Success/failure rates
  - Storage usage
  - Queue backlog size

- **System Metrics**
  - CPU and memory utilization
  - Disk I/O and network bandwidth
  - Elasticsearch performance
  - Queue system health
  - CDN performance and cache hit rates

### High Availability
- **Failover**
  - Implement automated failover for critical services
  - Set up regular backups
  - Document recovery procedures
  - Regular disaster recovery testing
