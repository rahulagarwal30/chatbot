### Growth Phase (Phase 2)
As the project scales, we'll expand with specialized roles:

- QA Engineers (2)
- DevOps Engineers (2)
- AI/ML Engineer (1)

- Support Engineers (2)

## 2. Talent Acquisition Strategy

### Internal Sourcing
Priority will be given to internal candidates who demonstrate:
- Interest in innovative projects
- Willingness to learn new technologies
- Experience with AI/ML systems

### External Hiring
When internal talent cannot be sourced:
1. Prioritize referrals for senior positions
